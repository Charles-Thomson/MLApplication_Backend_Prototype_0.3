# TODO: Issue with model -> instance due to the way the instaces are created
# May need to create a new instance type in brain factory ?
# Or make changes to how the brains are constructed - move generational func out of the config ?
# Need to generally rething the gneration procees of agents and brains as it's complicated and not easy to test

# idea
# have a build config for the building of a brain, then a json/dict storing the needed functions


# TODO Next
# Work out the depth of file when calling testing
# this will be different to the depth when calling django runserver so may cause issues
# Mabtbe set it to work around the django calls?
