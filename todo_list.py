# TODO Today:
# Logging
# all logging in one file
# currently debugging
# params are being passed in the wrong order
# look into the ID system again as it's not great still

# finish bug testing then refactor down the logging

# 2. Stat refactoring down the instance_generation file
# Look into the ID system all the way down - it,s not very descriptive of cohesive currently


# 3. refactor down other files where possible

# 4. move onto the views file
# Work out the return data structure thats needed
# write the functions to get the relervent data from th DB and fromat


# Look into how to properly use the get.loger functions
# Wrapper on the run_generation function
# logging of the average fitness per generation
# logging of the brain instance_paths and the related fitness's
# - by generation and instance

# Can some of the data_modeling/interal_functions be refacroted down ? - can change the function to get

# data back from Learning instance and generational mdodels to use a factory on the serializers ?

# Is the generation id the same as the DB ref for the data base ??

# Naming convention across the files need to be fixed , generation_db_ref to generation instance ref ect is bad

# Fix views side of the DB
# add generation_number to the brain instance model
